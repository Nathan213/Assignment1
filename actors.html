                Nathan Li is a Chinese native who grew up in Antartica with wolves. How he got there as an infant is unknown.
                What we do know is Nathan was eventually picked up by the Big Bang Theory crew and brought to Los Angles. There,
                he discovered his natural talent of impressions and his deep passion for speech. He brings both into this video, 
                fully demonstrating his god-given talent.
