            <h2>
                According to Members of the Academy: "'The Sorrows of Progression' was a surprise submission this year. 
                It originates from a small time film festival called 30 minute film festival, focused more on competitive
                speed than quality. It is surprsing how a high pressured, time sensitive film festival was able to submit a play as sophisticated,
                thoughtful, and well produced as 'The Sorrows of Progression.' This commitee has high hopes that 'The Sorrows of Progression'
                will collect several awards this year.
